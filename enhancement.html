## Building a Website in Layers


Content First
Start by deciding what content and features you want to have. Add them to your document as plain text.

Styling
Add CSS for readability, and then for layout, and finally for device-specific things like hover states. Test on different devices along the way, to see if the content and features can be read and used.

Scripting
Add JavaScript as needed for special interaction and features that aren’t available using HTML and CSS.

Use plain HTML elements as a starting point.

Try to leave things out of the markup that aren’t part of the core content. Keep it simple. 

If something requires JavaScript to operate and isn’t essential (there are other ways to accomplish the task), use JavaScript to add it later.

[Example with JavaScript template blocks]

Use styles to move the markup in the direction of your design.

Test along the way to see if the content and page features work well on a few different size devices.

Use JavaScript to enhance the markup and style and push it as close as possible to the design.

Test along the way with JavaScript turned off to see your content and features are still readable.

You should now have a functioning website that will function and allow anyone to read the content, even if something goes wrong with the JavaScript or if the CSS doesn’t load.

If you’re doing something essential with AJAX, set it up with a regular HTML form first and then hijack it with JavaScript.

Break your JavaScript up into discrete bits and use feature detection to turn each one off if it’s not supported.

Use CSS for animation and only add JavaScript if you need it for things like events and timing.

Use CSS for mouse overs, and be sure the content is still readable without them.

Use regular full pages instead of popups (hijack them with AJAX aftere the fact, if you want to present them as a popup).
