Content First
Start by deciding what content and features you want to have. Add them to your document as plain text.

Elements

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
Use headlines for text that begins a new section or that labels group of elements

p
Use paragraphs for text that represents a connected thought; and would have a pause before or after if you were speaking it in conversation.

em
Use an em element to emphasize a portion of your text.

strong
Use a strong element for text that would be spoken loudly or firmly in a conversation.

ol, li
Use an ordered list to add a list of items–each within an “li”–to your document, where the order of the items is deliberate and has significance.

ul, li
Use an unordered list if the order is not significant.

a
Connect to other documents or parts of a page, using with a hyperlink. Links should have a label that describes the destination. Use a “title” attribute, if the label isn’t clear enough.

img
Add an image to your document with an img element. If you replace some text with the image, write the text in the image’s “alt” attribute. If the image is itself part of the content, place it near text that describes it.

audio
Use an audio element to add a song to your document. Place the audio near text that describes it.

video
Use a video element to add a movie to your document. Place the video near text that describes it.

section
Use a section to group related content together.

article
Use an article instead of a section if the content stands on its own, and will make sense outside of the document.

header
Use a header element for headlines and other text that describes or helps navigate a section.

aside
Use an aside element instead of a section if the content is related to the other content on the page, but not part of it.

nav
Use a navigation element for a group of links that serve as the primary way to get around a web site or document.

form
Use a form to group together fields and buttons

input, select, textarea, and button
Use these to add fields and buttons within the form for gathering data

Accessibilty
persons
devices
robots

Styling
Add CSS for readability, and then for layout, and finally for device-specific things like hover states. Test on different devices along the way, to see if the content and features can be read and used.

Scripting
Add JavaScript as needed for special interaction and features that aren’t available using HTML and CSS.

Patterns
If you use a particular bit of HTML a few times, save it to a file so you can reuse it in your next project.
