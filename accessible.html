  <h1>HTML is inherently fast, responsive, and accessible.</h1>

  <h2>Delegate to the browser or device</h2>

  <p>By writing accessible HTML and using progressive enhancement, you delegate support for your content and features to the browser or device. Rather than doing it all yourself by building from scratch, you’re handing off responsibility for basic features so you can focus on what makes your application unique.</p>

  <p>If you use flow-based content as much as possible, you delegate the flexibility of the page width to the browser. Rather than writing complex layout rules for everything, you can focus on making your site more readable and easier to use by enhancing the existing layout when you know the screen is large enough to accommodate your changes.</p>

  <p>If you take advantage of built-in browser features at every opportunity and add what you need on top of them, your site will download and render faster; using less bandwidth and processing power on the client.</p>
