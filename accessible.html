<h1>Accessible</h1>

HTML starts out fast, responsive, simple and easy.

You can make things faster, but not making them slower.

You can make things responsive by not making them rigid.

You can make things simple by not making them complicated.

You can make things easy by not making them hard.

Make the site that you want to use.




## Delegate to the browser and device

By writing accessible HTML and using progressive enhancement, you delegate the feature support to the browser or device. Rather than doing everything yourself, youâ€™re handing off that responsibility, so you can focus on what makes your application unique.

If you use flow-based content as much as possible, you delegate the flexibility of the page width to the browser. And then you can focus on using positioned content only when you know the screen is large enough to accommodate a more intricate layout.
