  <h1>HTML is inherently fast, responsive, and accessible.</h1>

  <h2>Delegate to the browser or device</h2>

  <p>By writing accessible HTML and using progressive enhancement, you delegate the feature support to the browser or device. Rather than doing everything yourself, you’re handing off responsibility for basic features, so you can focus on what makes your application unique.</p>

  <p>If you use flow-based content as much as possible, you delegate the flexibility of the page width to the browser. And then you can focus on using positioned content only when you know the screen is large enough to accommodate a more intricate layout.</p>

  <p>If you take advantage of built-in browser features at every opportunity, and add what you need, your site will download and render faster, using less bandwidth and processing power on the client.</p>
